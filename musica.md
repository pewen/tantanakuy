You have a handful of ways to try out LXDE.

#### But I am totally new to those Linux things

We encourage you to try out Lubuntu, which is based on Ubuntu Linux, and made
by our community members.

</ul>

#### I have a Linux or BSD running on my computer, and I want to try LXDE

Sure. You can install LXDE easily. Please follow the wiki page to find out how to install LXDE
for your distribution.

</ul>

#### I want to buy a low-budget computer with LXDE

If you want to buy a computer, you can consider getting a single-board computer
for a fraction of the price.  Many single-board computers preloaded LXDE as
their default desktop environment.

You could also consider getting a computer from a local computer recyclers and
ask them to install Lubuntu on it.

Although it could run on the computers with RAM as small as 256MiB, We
recommend getting a computer with RAM of 1GiB or above for applications running
on it, such as web browser, video player and office suite.

#### I would like to get the source code

If you are looking for the source code, we are hosting them in the SourceForge
projects:
